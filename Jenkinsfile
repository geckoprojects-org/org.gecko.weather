// The publishing pipeline. GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/build.yml) only builds and tests;
// this is the one that publishes:
//
//   any other branch  build, test
//   snapshot          build, test, release ${tstamp}-SNAPSHOT bundles to the DIM Nexus (dim-snapshot)
//   main              build, test, release bare-version bundles to the DIM Nexus (dim-release)
//                     and, signed, into dist/bundles, which bnd's sonatype-upload.sh hands to the
//                     Sonatype Central Portal as one deployment; then export the launch as a drift check
//   sunorcloud_main   the same as main without the Nexus, to try the release before main moves
//                     onto this history
//
// The mechanics live in cnf/ext/release.bnd and the fennec library (releng/*.bnd), see
// docs/12-build-and-release.md. DO_RELEASE decides the version the bundles are built with,
// so build and release share one invocation.
// One publish for both branches, set up the way the old weather pipeline ran on this Jenkins:
//   GNUPG_PASSPHRASE   environment of the Jenkins (the old DIM library read exactly this name);
//                      the fennec library's name is GPG_PASSPHRASE, so it is mapped
//   GNUPGHOME          the node's keyring with the signing key, /var/jenkins_home/.gnupg as before
//   dim-nexus          Jenkins credential, username/password: the DIM Nexus login
//   central-portal-token  Jenkins credential, username/password: the Sonatype Central Portal user
//                      token (CS_USERNAME/CS_PASSWORD) — new, the old library spoke to OSSRH
// Optional, for a Jenkins that keeps them as credentials instead: gnupg-passphrase (secret text)
// and gnupg-private-key (secret file, imported into a keyring of this run).
// GPG_PASSPHRASE is what makes the fennec library add the Sonatype repository and sign: a snapshot
// goes to the Portal's snapshot repository, a release is uploaded by centralUpload(). Both targets
// are the point of this stage, so anything missing fails the run with its name.
